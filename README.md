# Blooger Bootstrap

Example template for building a blog with Gatsby and using Bootstrap for 
styling. 

## To Do:
- [x] Add info sidebar with picture, short blurb, and icons with my skills
- [x] Cleanup styles on the sidebar, look at margin-right for image.
- [x] Look at adding a vertical line separating the sidebar and main content
- [x] Add favicons with fontawesome and add below sidebar in social icons section
- [x] Add links to LinkedIn and github pages
- [x] Add info top section that provides a short blurb, small picture and is only visible on mobile
- [x] Move Layout to components directory
- [x] Add **Footer** section
- [x] Add **About** page that provides rundown of me and my LinkedIn profile and skills
- [] Add favicons and images so I can identify the tab on my browser
- [] Add links to previous and next blog entries
- [] Copy the font styles in the example blog link that I have on my laptop
- [] Create standard text formatting in the website.
- [] Refactor the social icons in the Footer to the BloggerInfoSocialIcons
- [] Copy repository to a new blog repository
- [] Add **SEO** plugin and configure in the site
- [] Add **Netlify** plugin and deploy production version of the site
- [] Link www.mcdaley.com to Netlify page, so I can add to my resume
- [] Add **Comments** section to blog posts
- [] Add **Contact** section with a form to email me
- [] Add **Search** form using 3rd party plugin

## Bugs:
- [] Figure out why the navbar logo and links move down when I click on About and Contact

## Future Tasks
- [] For SEO I will want a <h1> tag on the page, but I currently do not have one on index.js. Should I add a hidden one?
- [] Add global text in gatsby-config.js as in tutorial to remove all hard-coded text
     that is specific to me (e.g., tagline, name, linked-in link,...)
- [] Investigate removing the PrismJS plugins for styling the <pre> and <code> blocks
- [] Look at using a vertical divider or background w/ linear gradient to implement
     vertical line that separates the blogger-info and list of blogger posts

## Running in development
